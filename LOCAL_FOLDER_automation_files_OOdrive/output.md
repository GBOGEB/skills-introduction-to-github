| Con     | A preliminary engineering framework that defines the       |
| ceptual | cryogenic helium refrigeration architecture, supporting a  |
| Process | range of operational and functional requirements. The      |
| P       | Conceptual Process Proposal serves as the foundation for   |
| roposal | subsequent design stages by detailing the system           |
|         | architecture, proposed configurations, and functional      |
|         | decompositions necessary to meet the overarching System    |
|         | Requirements. It ensures integration of key subsystems and |
|         | process units while maintaining compliance with            |
|         | operational constraints, safety margins, and performance   |
|         | criteria. It is reviewed and validated as a baseline for   |

| tage(s) |   process, each focusing on a distinct level of technical  |
|         |   maturity and output deliverables. Design Stages are      |
|         |   sequenced to transform user requirements into            |
|         |   realizable system configurations through increasing      |
|         |   levels of fidelity and validation.                       |

|         | Conceptual Design: A phase in the design process that      |
|         | involves evaluating multiple concepts to determine their   |
|         | ability to fulfil the defined fit-for-purpose              |
|         | requirements. It includes the identification and           |
|         | justification of a reference concept deemed the most       |
|         | suitable and feasible within the specified constraints.    |
|         | The Conceptual Design provides a general understanding of  |
|         | the system\'s intended purpose, overall structure,         |
|         | operating principles, physical dimensions, and key         |
|         | technical specifications. Once reviewed and approved, the  |
|         | Conceptual Design serves as the foundation for the         |
|         | development of the Detailed Design.                        |
|         |                                                            |
|         | Detailed Design: This stage develops the finalized and     |
|         | exhaustive Design Documentation required for fabrication,  |
|         | inspection, testing, installation, commissioning,          |
|         | operation, maintenance, refurbishment, and decommissioning |
|         | of the System. Documentation must meet quality,            |
|         | regulatory, and lifecycle expectations.                    |

| Li      | The cost optimization approach used during the             |
| fecycle | post-commissioning phase to manage preventive maintenance, |
| Cost    | replacement strategy, and reliability targets. It is       |
| Man     | supported by failure forecasting, risk-based planning, and |
| agement | system performance modelling to maintain or reduce         |
|         | lifetime cost without compromising function.               |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Reli    | A systematic and structured process to determine the most  |
| ability | effective maintenance approach for an asset or system. RCM |
| Centred | seeks to ensure that systems continue to do what their     |
| Main    | users require in their current operating context. It       |
| tenance | involves identifying failure modes, assessing their        |
|         | consequences, and selecting proactive maintenance tasks to |
|         | mitigate risk while optimizing cost, safety, and system    |
|         | availability.                                              |

1.  []{#_Toc198308205 .anchor}Introduction

"Phase 1 -- Implementation" of the MYRRHA program focuses on the design,
construction and commissioning of a 4 mA 100MeV super-conducting CW
proton Linear Accelerator (LINAC), a Proton Target Facility (PTF) and a
Full Power Facility (FPF). (Phase 2 of the MYRRHA program will be the
extension to 600 MeV). Further information about MYRRHA Phase I is
provided in reference AD3.

1.  []{#_Toc188541027 .anchor}The LINAC

The LINAC (\~100 m length) consists of a normal conducting injector,
followed by a superconducting section. The latter section accelerates
protons from 17 to 100 MeV using 352.2 MHz single-spoke cavities
operating at 2 K. Each Cavity (CAV) is submerged in saturated superfluid
helium (He II) within Helium Tanks (HT), organized into pairs inside a
Cryomodule (QM). Each QM is connected to a dedicated Cryogenic Valve Box
(QVB). The combination of one QM and one QVB is called a Cryo-Cell
(QCELL). The full LINAC configuration will comprise sixty CAVs in thirty
QMs. Initial deployment includes twenty-four QMs; the remaining six are
to be added later.

2.  []{#_Toc188541028 .anchor}Cryogenic System

The Cryoplant (QPLANT), a subsystem of the Cryogenic System (Figure 1),
is designed to provide refrigeration to QMs via the Cryogenic
Distribution System (QDIST).

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ![](media/image5.emf)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  : []{#_Ref192158138 .anchor}Table 2 Operational Scenarios of the
  Cryogenic System

QDIST comprises the QLM, the string of QVBs, and the QVE. The QLM houses
the main headers distributing cold helium at multiple temperature
levels. The QLM enters the LINAC Tunnel (LTU) via a radiation-protection
chicane. Each QCELL regulates its helium mass flow by

tapping from and returning to the distribution headers. Additionally,
QVBs include He II conditioning

capabilities. Excess flow is bypassed through the QVE.

The QPLANT includes a WCS connected to helium storage vessels, a

Cold Box for refrigeration processes, and process equipment for drying,
oil removal, gas management, and

purification. An indicative Process Flow Diagram of the QPLANT is shown
in *Figure 2*.

![](media/image7.emf)

The QPLANT is located in different areas as shown in the layout in
*Figure 3:*

-   Compressor Room: Location for the Warm Compression Station (WCS)

-   Storage Area (outside): Location for helium storage vessels and (if
    needed) liquid nitrogen storage vessels.

-   Cold Box Room: Location for the QRB with the associated warm panel.
    In addition, if a liquid helium storage is needed for the operation
    of the cryogenic system, it is in this room.

-   Connecting rooms: The Warm lines from the WCS to the QRB cross
    multiple other rooms.

3.  Introduction to CIS

The **Control and Interlock System (CIS)** performs controls and safety
related functions on the primary systems. It consists of two main
components:

-   SCK CEN Control System (MCS):

MCS manages and monitors all devices and processes. It sends commands to
operate various parts of the system (e.g. RF generators, magnets, and
the QPLANT) and continuously collects data to ensure everything is
running correctly. Its focus is on performance and operational
efficiency.

-   SCK CEN Interlock System (MIS):

MIS works side-by-side with MCS but with a different goal. Its main job
is safety. MIS is an independent, fail-safe system that immediately
steps in to prevent accidents, such as equipment damage or any risk to
personnel, by cutting off or altering operations if something goes
wrong.

-   Information Technology (MIT):

MIT provides the supporting IT infrastructure for the entire facility.
This includes networking, servers, user authentication, data storage,
and backup services. Essentially, MIT makes sure that all the systems
(primary and secondary) can communicate reliably, and that data is
managed securely.

3.  []{#_Toc198308214 .anchor}Technical Requirements

    1.  []{#_Toc198308215 .anchor}General Requirements

<!-- -->

1.  The Contractor shall be fully responsible for ensuring that the
    Deliverables and Services provided fully meet the specified
    requirements for the Contract. Therefore, the Applicant shall duly
    analyse the SCK CEN's Tender Documents and evaluate whether
    sufficient information is presented to allow the Applicant to put
    forward a proposal that ensures that the delivery of the procured
    items meet the specified requirements.

<!-- -->

3.  If certain information is found to be lacking, the Applicant must
    request this information from SCK CEN without undue delay (according
    to *[§1.6]{.mark}* of the Main Tender Document). In accordance with
    *[§1.7]{.mark}* of the Main Tender Document, the Contractor may no
    longer rely on information lacking after submission of its offer. If
    the Contractor would only identify a lack of information during the
    performance of the Contract, this will not give rise to any basis
    for a Variation.

4.  In the offer, the Applicant shall list the requirements (in addition
    to the SCK CEN's requirements) which have been defined by the
    Applicant (as well as any assumptions made to define such
    requirements) and which shall be used as a basis for the definition
    and execution of the Contract.

5.  The technical requirements imposed by the SCK CEN (including, but
    not limited to norms and other standards, processes, and their
    parameters) applicable to the development, performance, and quality
    (inspections, tests, etc.) of the procured items are specified in
    the present document and all other documents referred to herein.

    In principle, these requirements are mandatory, unless adjusted in
    accordance with the principles set forth in the subsequent
    paragraphs.

6.  If certain of these technical requirements are not met (for example:
    if a requested norm or standard, or a preferred process (parameter),
    is not implemented by the Applicant), the Applicant shall clearly
    state this deviation in his offer. The Applicant shall also provide
    a clear description of the deviation (e.g.: indicating which
    norm/standard or process (parameter) shall be implemented as an
    alternative to the requested one) and shall justify this choice.

7.  In its offer, the Applicant may suggest modifications vis-à-vis the
    technical requirements as imposed by the present document, which, in
    the Applicant's opinion, would constitute an improvement in terms of
    cost, reliability, safety, ease of use, or any other improvement of
    the QPLANT. For each modification, the Applicant shall demonstrate
    its advantages as well as list the drawbacks (if any). 

8.  The Applicant shall submit one offer, including all modifications,
    which in the Applicant's view constitutes the most optimal solution
    for the QPLANT. It is not allowed to submit multiple offers covering
    multiple solutions.  

In the offer, the Applicant is to give a clear overview of the main
activities that shall constitute the Contract performance. For each
activity, the Applicant is to provide information regarding i.a. how the
applicable requirements shall be met, the chosen process(es) and
technique(s) that shall be implemented, etc. Where applicable, the
Applicant is to give at least the details as requested in the present
document; if no specific details are requested in the present document,
the Applicant is to choose, based on its experience, the appropriate
(level of) detail(s) to be provided in relation to the criticality
and/or complexity of the activity.

9.  During negotiations, if any, the deviations and modifications shall
    be discussed between SCK CEN and the Applicant. SCK CEN reserves the
    right, at its sole discretion, to refuse deviations and/or
    modifications without justification of its decision. Only deviations
    and modifications for which the Applicant has received SCK CEN's
    prior written approval may be implemented.

cryogenic distribution

10. When in 4.5K standby, the QPLANT shall allow the (partial) stop of
    the (cold and/or warm) VLP compressors.

For the 2K operation scenario, the operation temperatures and pressures
are the nominal ones: it requires cavity bath at 2 K (saturated
superfluid helium with 31 mbar), the thermal shields supplied at 40 K
and the coupler cooled between 5 K and 300 K. The superfluid helium
levels and the bath pressure are controlled for each QCELL. The heat
loads dissipated in the helium bath is a function of the RF power in the
cavities.

For the 2K Standby scenario, the operation temperatures and pressures
are the similar to the 2K operation with the distinction that the
stability requirements are relaxed as there is no RF operation. This
operation mode may be used in the preparation phase before and after
accelerator operations.

1.  []{#_Ref192411691 .anchor}Transient operational Scenarios

[]{#_Toc198308220 .anchor}Background information

All QCELL's will be cooled down in parallel.

During cool-down and warm-up, cavities and cryomodules impose the
following requirements and constraints on the QPLANT operation:

-   The magnetic shields must reach a temperature T \< 70 K before the
    cavities reach T \< 10 K. In order to guarantee this, each QCELL
    autonomously limits its cool down speed.

[For proper interface modeling, the following user-side input data shall
be provided by SCK CEN after contract granting:]{.mark}

-   [The static heat load as a function of temperature, Q_static = f(T),
    for each relevant circuit.]{.mark}

-   [The total energy to be extracted, E_extract = f(T).]{.mark}

<!-- -->

-   Although material and mechanical stress due to differential
    temperature gradients impose some limits, a cooldown speed of up to
    20 K/h (equivalent to \~12 hours) is acceptable for the "cooldown to
    50 K". As an example, the required cooling power for a 4 K/h
    cool-down rate (corresponding to 72 hours) is provided in the
    appendix.

<!-- -->

-   There is no constraint imposed on the cool-down speed for the "Cool
    down to 4.5K".

QCELLs are equipped with heaters in their 2 K tanks. One of the main
functions of these heaters is to accelerate the warm-up process by:

-   Evaporating the remaining liquid helium to vapor (isothermal phase)
    to assist in tank emptying.

-   Increasing the enthalpy of the cold mass (reheating the structural
    material).

The total power of these heaters is 600 Watt. This power may be adjusted
to match what the QPLANT can absorb.

SCK CEN does not impose a warm-up rate nor the use of QCELL heaters,
particularly during the liquid emptying phase, as part of the
operational requirements towards the QPLANT.

11. The QPLANT shall support the transitions given in Figure 6.

23. Average retention rate of 0.8 g/s LHe per individual QCELL (24 g/s
    total) during the filling process

    the users.

    In their offer, the Applicant shall indicate the expected duration

Procurement and installation of helium gas storage facilities on the SCK
CEN site are part of *Option 1*.

322. The Contractor shall define the total helium inventory required for
     the entire cryogenic system based on the helium inventory specified
     for the cryogenic users in *Table 9* as well as for the QPLANT,
     regardless of whether *Option 1* is granted.

323. The helium gas storage on site shall be sized for the full helium
     inventory, as required by the operation modes and availability.

324. The High Pressure of the WCS shall be used as the maximum storage
     pressure when calculating the storage volume required to
     accommodate the full helium inventory.

325. A minimum of three vessels shall be considered to store the full
     helium inventory of the Cryogenic System.

326. As a contingency to account for potential volume deficiencies and
     to include operational margins to offset helium loss, a margin of
     20% shall be applied to the helium inventories and the
     corresponding helium storage facilities.

327. To minimize the footprint impact in the storage area, the vertical
     positioning of the helium storage vessels is currently considered
     as baseline. However, the final volumes and arrangement shall be
     validated by SCK CEN.

1.  []{#_Toc198308301 .anchor}QPLANT Control System

    1.  []{#_Toc198308302 .anchor}Overview

The QPLANT Control System (QPLANT:CS) shall be designed specifically for
the local control of the QPLANT and the helium storage system, ensuring
that all cryogenic processes operate safely and efficiently on site.

The QPLANT:CS is integrated with MCS to

-   exchange any information between the QPLANT:CS and the cyrogenic
    users.

-   create a unified operator experience showing the QPLANT:CS data and
    controls through a single user-friendly interface, allowing the
    operator to monitor and manage the QPLANT seamlessly alongside other
    primary systems.

Furthermore, all IT-related services - ranging from network
communication and data storage to backup and user authentication - are
integrated with the Information Technology (MIT) platform. This
integration ensures that all the data and control signals from QPLANT:CS
and MCS are supported by a robust and secure IT infrastructure,
providing reliability and efficiency across the entire system.

Within the overall safety framework, the QPLANT Control System
(QPLANT:CS) is dedicated solely to the local control and protection of
the QPLANT. It handles immediate, on-site safety functions, such as
local shutdowns or protective actions in response to detected issues.
However, when the QPLANT interacts with other systems, the
responsibility for ensuring global safety shifts to the Interlock System
(MIS).

340. The QPLANT:CS shall incorporate at least the components shown in
     green in the reference architecture defined in Figure 8.
     Furthermore, it shall include any additional systems or subsystems
     required to meet the overall performance, functionality, and safety
     objectives of the cryogenic plant.

341. The QPLANT:CS shall use a commercially available control system
     that is industrial-grade and proven in comparable applications,
     meeting predefined performance, safety, and reliability standards;
     it shall be procurable off-the-shelf from an approved vendor with
     documented lifecycle support and compliance with relevant
     regulatory requirements to ensure long-term system sustainability
     and minimal vendor dependence.

342. The QPLANT:CS shall enable autonomous operation (without operator
     intervention) of the QPLANT across all specified scenarios and
     transitions between them.

343. [The Contractor shall]{.mark} deliver of a fit-for-purpose Test
     System for System Under Test (SUT) which is used during functional
     testing, validation, and commissioning of QPLANT and QPLANT:CS.
     This Test System shall:

     -   Represent key operational states (start-up, shut-down,
         transients, faulted/degraded performance).

     -   Support alarm logic verification, interlock testing, and
         diagnostics without reliance on a live operational system.

344. The Contractor shall not be required to implement a digital twin
     per se; however:

-   If a validated digital twin or process-control simulation model
    (e.g., Simulink®, SimCryogenics, RNN, empirical/statistical
    thermodynamic or reliability models) is proposed, it must be:

    -   Based on certified, validated, or standards-compliant toolsets.

    -   Configured to support operator training, diagnostics, and
        maintenance planning.

    -   Allow future Integration with instrumentation and control system
        architecture to enable virtual sensors or diagnostic inference.

-   If no model is proposed, the Applicant shall:

    -   Explicitly state and justify the exclusion, supported by a
        cost-benefit or reliability impact rationale.

    -   Describe in detail the alternate approach used for initiating
        event training, commissioning testing, and system diagnostics.

    -   Demonstrate how operational reliability, functional
        verification, and maintenance readiness are ensured in the
        absence of a digital model.

In the offer, the Applicant shall provide substantiated details:
Contractor's proposed SUT and test system description; Declaration of
modelling approach (or exclusion), with justification; Simulation
capabilities or testing methodology documentation; Operator training
protocols and model/test system interface

345. Controlling mass flow rate and supply temperature: The QPLANT shall
     supply and regulate the mass flow rate and supply temperature at
     the QPLANT--QCELL interface (via QINFRA to QRB in the coldbox
     room), such that the temperature change rate---during both
     cool-down and warm-up---of each QCELL remains within predefined and
     controlled limits. The temperature change rate is defined as the
     maximum allowable rate of change of the internal QCELL temperature,
     expressed in K/h (e.g., 4 K/h). These limits shall be adjustable
     via process control, depending on the thermal inertia of each QCELL
     and the operational mode.

346. The QPLANT:CS shall support bidirectional communication with the
     Broker, exchanging real-time operational and control signals at an
     update rate of 1 Hz. This will be used by the Broker system,
     implemented within MCS, to actively control and enforce this
     temperature change rate by issuing setpoints and operational
     constraints to the QPLANT Control System (QPLANT:CS).

     1.  []{#_Toc198308308 .anchor}Human Machine Interface (HMI)

373. Local Operator Station: The Contractor shall deliver local operator
     stations to provide local data collection and reporting for the
     QPLANT system to support maintenance activities. As a minimum one
     is expected in the Compressor Room and one in the Cold Box Room.

374. No Full SCADA System: The Contractor shall not deliver or implement
     an enterprise level QPLANT SCADA system (multi-user or multi-server
     architecture) as part of the scope.

375. Temporary SCADA System for Standalone Commissioning:\
     The Contractor shall deliver and implement a temporary QPLANT SCADA
     system exclusively for use during the standalone commissioning
     phase. This solution is intended solely to support initial testing,
     commissioning, and operator training, and should be decommissioned
     and replaced by the MCS solution once integration is realized. This
     temporary system shall also be used as reference design for the
     development of the MCS Navigator therefor sufficient documentation
     is required.

376. Integration Support: The Contractor shall provide support for
     integration of the QPLANT Control System with the MCS Navigator.
     This includes, but is not limited to:

-   Providing support in designing the Operator Screen for the Plant.

-   Supplying necessary communication protocols (e.g., OPC UA, TCP/IP)

-   Coordinating with the project SCADA team to ensure data consistency
    (e.g., tags, alarms)

-   Sharing relevant technical documentation and engineering details to
    enable seamless integration

377. Industrial-Grade Platform: The Contractor shall ensure that the
     operator stations (whether HMI panels or dedicated Industrial touch
     PCs) are based on industrial-grade hardware specifically designed
     for continuous operation in a production environment. This includes
     robust construction, compatibility with the QPLANT's environmental
     conditions (temperature, dust, vibrations, etc.), and adherence to
     relevant industrial standards.

378. Long-Term Software Update Support: The platform shall be supported
     with software updates, firmware updates, and security patches for a
     minimum of 20 years from the date of commissioning. The Contractor
     shall provide documentation or official manufacturer statements
     guaranteeing availability of updates throughout this period.

379. Migration to Newer Hardware: The visualization (HMI) project shall
     be designed in such a way that it can be migrated to newer hardware
     of the same manufacturer if the originally delivered hardware
     becomes obsolete or requires upgrade. This includes ensuring future
     compatibility of project files and software licenses, and providing
     guidelines for seamless transfer of project data and
     configurations.

380. The touchscreen display shall have a minimum diagonal size of 24
     inches to ensure sufficient screen space for detailed process
     graphics and user interaction.

381. The display shall support a resolution suitable for clear viewing
     of process graphics, text, and trends. A minimum resolution of
     1920×1080 (Full HD) is recommended for a 24-inch display.

382. Where the system includes a local Human Machine Interface (HMI)
     that supports local control, it shall implement a control selection
     mechanism based on a 3-state principle: Local - Free - Remote.
     Local or remote control can only be granted when the system is in
     the \"Free\" state. If the system is not free, the requester will
     be denied the requested control, and any write commands from that
     side will be ignored. However, reading the system state shall
     always be permitted in any state, allowing either side to retrieve
     information about the system\'s status and confirming whether a
     request was successful. Writing (changing) is only allowed when the
     request is accepted. It is important to note that this control
     mechanism only pertains to local versus remote control states. Any
     other state machines within the system shall remain active,
     ensuring that, for example, regulation loops continue to function
     in either state.

383. Release: Once a system is reserved in a specific control mode, it
     shall automatically transition to the \"Free\" state if a
     configurable timeout period (maximum of 5 minutes) of non-activity
     expires. \"Releasing\" means transitioning from a specific control
     state to the \"Free\" state. Non-activity refers to the absence of
     local or remote actions.

384. Non-Critical System Role: The Operator Station shall be designed as
     a non-critical component of the control system. No real-time or
     safety-critical control functions shall reside in the Operator
     Station; it is purely for monitoring, visualization, and local
     interaction.

385. Data Storage & Retention: The Operator Station shall store
     operational data (e.g., trends, alarms) only for a limited amount
     of time, sufficient for short-term analysis and troubleshooting.
     The data stored locally shall not be formally backed up; once data
     ages out of the configured retention period, it may be overwritten
     or discarded.

386. The Operator Station shall provide capabilities for plotting curves
     and trends, enabling real-time and short-term historical
     visualization of key process variables.

387. The Operator Station shall include graphical process views,
     providing an intuitive interface for monitoring equipment states
     and process flows.

388. The Operator Station shall show and log alarms and events for
     immediate operator awareness without functionality to acknowledge
     alarm occurrences

389. Graphical process views shall be agreed with SCK CEN.

390. All the sensors and actuators shall be integrated in different
     graphical views.

391. The Operator Station software shall support a default data
     acquisition period of maximum two seconds. For critical turbine
     data an acquisition rate of 100 ms is required.

392. The HMI software shall allow at least two permission levels with
     different functions available.

393. The HMI software package shall allow to automatically call or
     e-mail "on call" staff through MIT (see *Figure 8*).

394. The graphical views shall be in accordance with the Process &
     Instrumentation Diagrams to easily understand and operate the
     system.

395. The HMI software package shall be installed on two workstations
     with large screens (at least height 24 inches monitors) to
     visualize the useful information during QPLANT operation (see
     *Figure 8*).

     Management (LCM) strategy supporting a fixed-price contractual
     framework.\
     \
     The LCM strategy shall integrate as per ISO 15288:2023: Capital
     Expenditure (CAPEX), Operational Expenditure (OPEX), Maintenance
     forecasting and spares replacement, Upgrade and obsolescence
     planning, End-of-life and disposal planning

     It shall comply with principles and methodologies of: ISO 15686-5
     (Lifecycle Costing), IEC 60300-3-3 (Reliability-Centered
     Maintenance), and ISO 55000 (Asset Management).

In the Offer, the Applicant shall provide the expected lifecycle cost
including the main cost driving elements, including but not limited to:

-   RCM strategy details.

-   MTBF of main components and systems;

-   PFD and SIL analysis;

-   Spare part strategy (e.g. replace, run to fail, ....);

-   OPEX items like electricity, maintenance staff need

616. In the offer, the Applicant shall explicitly describe, quantify,
     and justify their proposed Reliability-Centred Maintenance (RCM)
     strategy for QPLANT and QPLANT:CS. This shall include whether a
     validated digital model (e.g., process twin, thermodynamic model,
     control system simulation, or AI-based reliability estimator) is
     used to support diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and lifecycle
     cost reduction via virtual sensors and replacement deferrals.

     *If a validated model is included, the Applicant shall provide:*

     An explanation of how the model contributes to:

-   Reduced MTBF-driven part replacement, based on predictive or
    condition-based intervention,

-   Generation of virtual signals where instrumentation is infeasible or
    cost-limiting,

-   Reduction in functional test cycles, unplanned outages, and
    inventory reserves.

    A quantified cost disclosure, covering:

-   Model development and integration into the QPLANT:CS design
    architecture and software stack,

-   Hardware and system-level impacts (BoM additions or changes for
    real-time integration, computing load, or I/O expansion),

-   Commissioning and acceptance testing activities supported or
    replaced by the model,

-   Ongoing model validation, updates, and QA/QC effort over the
    operational lifecycle

-   Integration of model upkeep as a line item in the RCM cost structure
    and lifecycle maintenance forecast.

    *If no model is proposed, the Applicant shall:*

-   Provide a rationale for its exclusion, with a supporting
    cost-benefit justification,

-   Detail the alternative methods for achieving equivalent RCM outcomes
    (e.g., historical statistics, empirical MTBF planning, SCADA-based
    failure diagnostics),

-   Describe the impact of the absence of a model on:

    -   Diagnostic scope and operator support, and training

    -   Testing coverage and lifecycle cost,

    -   Required commissioning and redundancy in QPLANT:CS design.

        In the offer, the applicant shall provide:

<!-- -->

-   Fixed-price offer section including the costed RCM strategy,

-   Model architecture or simulation integration summary (if
    applicable),

-   BoM elements attributable to the model (hardware/software),

-   Maintenance and diagnostic strategy for 5-year lifecycle horizon,

recurrence.For actions taking more than 1 month, the Contractor shall
provide a regular status report describing the result of implementation
according to the due dates in the action plan. Performing the root cause
analysis and implementing any preventive/corrective actions arising
therefrom, shall not give rise to any additional compensation for the
Contractor.Any Non-Conformities identified and reported by SCK CEN to
the Contractor, as well as any other complaints received by the
Contractor from SCK CEN, shall be treated as Non-Conformities and duly
documented, investigated and resolved according to the stipulations
under this clause*.*

    Non-Conformity management, nor the approval by SCK CEN of a
    Non-Conformity Report, shall waive or reduce the Contractor's
    responsibility, according to the relevant stipulations of the
    Contract, to indemnify and hold SCK CEN harmless against all losses,
    damages, and costs (e.g. due to delay on the schedule) arising from
    such Non-Conformity.[]{#_Toc198308398 .anchor}Audits

28. During the warranty period, the Contractor shall at its own risk and
    expense remedy any outstanding issues, as well as any shortcomings
    and defects that were not visible during the acceptance tests.

29. The Contractor's methods of solving a warranty issue shall always
    need to be approved in advance by SCK CEN. SCK CEN reserves the
    right, at its sole discretion, to not allow for repair and to demand
    replacement of a defective item.

30. In case the warranty work needs to be performed at SCK CEN, the
    Contractor shall take into account and comply with SCK CEN's
    instructions relating to working hours, access, etc., without being
    entitled to any additional compensation.

31. The Contractor's warranty obligation shall not apply:

    i.  
    ii. 
    iii. 

32. to normal wear and tear of the QPLANT, as well as any associated
    consumables. to defects of which the Contractor is notified after
    the Warranty period, unless SCK CEN can demonstrate that such defect
    has arisen before the end of the Warranty period in which case such
    defect shall fall under the warranty obligation. to failures or
    defects which the Contractor can substantiate are due to alteration,
    misapplication, inappropriate use in view of the conditions of use
    as outlined by the Contractor (if any are provided), and/or
    maintenance not carried out according to the Contractor's nominal
    conditions as set forth by the Contractor, lack of trained
    maintenance personnel (other than the Contractor's personnel),
    operation above rated capacities either intentional or otherwise, or
    physical damage caused by persons other than the Contractor's
    personnel. During the warranty period, the Contractor shall execute
    repairs and/or replacements without undue delay at the Contractor's
    risk and expense. SCK CEN may request warranty service during
    non-normal working hours or for services excluded from the warranty
    coverage as defined herein, provided that SCK CEN shall pay the
    reasonable overtime premium portion of the non-normal hours worked
    or the normal service charge respectively.

33. In-warranty repairs and/or replacement parts shall be warranted for
    at least one year after execution, or for the unexpired portion of
    the original warranty period of the deliverable, whichever is
    longest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the warranty period is
    suspended for the duration between formal notice by SCK CEN to the
    Contractor on the defect and resolving of said defect by the
    Contractor.

34. If the Contractor fails to fulfil its obligations under the
    warranty, so that final acceptance cannot take place at the
    scheduled time, the warranty period shall be automatically extended,
    without any right to compensation and/or remuneration for the
    Contractor, until final acceptance takes place.

35. The Contractor shall keep a register of all interventions that the
    Contractor performs during the warranty period which can be
    consulted by SCK CEN at all times. In the event that SCK CEN can
    demonstrate a trend of failure occurring during the warranty period,
    which is not attributable to any inappropriate use of the equipment,
    this will be considered as a deficiency and the Contractor shall be
    liable to replace at his own risk and expense the affected item.
    I.c. "trend" is defined as a similar occurrence, which is found at
    least 3 times.

36. In addition to the above rights, SCK CEN shall be entitled to full
    compensation for all damages incurred in view of these outstanding
    issues, shortcomings and/or defects during the warranty period for
    which the Contractor is responsible.

The warranty as described in this section shall in no way constitute a
restriction on the applicable Belgian statutory regulations on hidden
defects.

    1.  []{#_Toc198308413 .anchor}Cooling Power for Cool-down

Heat loads (W) refers to the heat power to be removed from the user
systems.

Heat capacity (W) corresponds to the power to be extracted from
materials of mass M to allow its cool-down at the defined cool-down
speed. **P ≈ MCdT/dt** (dT/dt being the cool-down speed and C the
specific heat capacity).

Cool-down power (W) is the required cooling power for cool-down = sum of
the two heat contributions.
